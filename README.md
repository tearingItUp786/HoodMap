# HoodMap
This was a project that I began working on while learning (for free) from the awesome people at [udacity.](www.udacity.com) The purpose of this project was to get students accustomed to using APIs (I employed yelp and google places) and the MVC pattern of development.

The application uses location information (lat and lng) provided by the developer to find the center of the map and make an ajax call to a php script which uses developer provided search terms to return data from yelp. The application then takes the data provided by yelp and uses it to draw markers on the map and well... just open the link at the bottom and see :).

**Version 1.5 and greater call a php script which may read and echo a text file (which is updated every weeek) as output in order to reduce the amount of time spent waiting for the yelp server to respond with the data for a prelim load**

Following is the list of APIs and resources I used, in no particular order:
* Knockout JS - Because Momma said knock you out... so I'm gonna knock you out
* SASS - Because everyone loves SASS
* Google places - Google places provides the map functionality
* Yelp - Yelp provides the data that feeds into Google Maps


**Note my solution does not include the server side changes I had to make (changes to htaccess files etc.)**
