# HoodMap
This was a project that I began working on while learning (for free) from the awesome people at [udacity.](www.udacity.com) The purpose of this project was to get students accustomed to using APIs (I employed yelp and google places) and the MVC pattern of development.

Following is the list of APIs and resources I used, in no particular order:
* Knockout JS - Because Momma said knock you out... so I'm gonna knock you out
* SASS - Because everyone loves SASS
* Google places - Google places provides the map functionality
* Yelp - Yelp provides the data that feeds into Google Maps
